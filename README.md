  ## Description
 A restaurant app that enables a user to save personal reviews about restaurant menu items and whether you enjoyed them or not.


     
          


     
     

  ## Motivation for Development
 Recalling details about previous meals or drinks youâ€™ve had at a specific eatery can sometimes be difficult to recall especially if it's been a long time since your last visit.



     
          

     
     

  ## User Story
 As a restaurant goer, I want an application where I can enter my personal reviews of dishes or drinks that I enjoyed so that I can easily recall them next time I visit.
